A modular, console-based C++ application simulating an airline reservation system. Built using object-oriented principles and classic data structures and algorithms, this project enables flight management, passenger booking, and reservation search with a focus on performance and real-world logic.
Project Overview

This system demonstrates:

 ✈️ Flight and passenger booking management
 🔍 Searching and sorting operations
 ⚙️ Algorithmic performance analysis
 🧠 Practical use of arrays and linked lists

Designed as a course project for **Data Structures & Algorithms**, this system applies theory to a meaningful real-world simulation.

Objectives

 Enable booking, updating, and canceling of flight reservations
 Implement multiple sorting and searching algorithms
 Compare arrays vs. linked lists in terms of time/space complexity
 Analyze and optimize real-time operations using classic DSA

Class Design

 `Flight`: Stores flight data (flight number, route, timings, seats)
 `Passenger`: Represents traveler details
 `Booking`: Node class for individual reservations
 `BookingList`: Custom singly linked list managing all bookings
